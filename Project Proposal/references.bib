Salient features of {SExtractor} include its ability to work on very large images, with minimal human intervention, and to deal with a wide variety of object shapes and magnitudes. It is therefore particularly suited to the analysis of large extragalactic surveys.},

	abstract = {The {DESI} Legacy Imaging Surveys (http://legacysurvey.org/) are a combination of three public projects (the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey, the Beijing–Arizona Sky Survey, and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey) that will jointly image ≈14,000 deg2 of the extragalactic sky visible from the northern hemisphere in three optical bands (g, r, and z) using telescopes at the Kitt Peak National Observatory and the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. The combined survey footprint is split into two contiguous areas by the Galactic plane. The optical imaging is conducted using a unique strategy of dynamically adjusting the exposure times and pointing selection during observing that results in a survey of nearly uniform depth. In addition to calibrated images, the project is delivering a catalog, constructed by using a probabilistic inference-based approach to estimate source shapes and brightnesses. The catalog includes photometry from the grz optical bands and from four mid-infrared bands (at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 μm) observed by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer satellite during its full operational lifetime. The project plans two public data releases each year. All the software used to generate the catalogs is also released with the data. This paper provides an overview of the Legacy Surveys project.},

This release includes data from the {DES} wide-area survey covering ∼5000 deg2 of the southern Galactic cap in ﬁve broad photometric bands, {grizY}. {DES} {DR}2 has a median delivered point-spread function {FWHM} of g = 1.11″, r = 0.95″, i = 0.88″, z = 0.83″, and Y = 0 90, photometric uniformity with a standard deviation of {\textless} 3 mmag with respect to Gaia {DR}2 G band, a photometric accuracy of ∼11 mmag, and a median internal astrometric precision of ∼27 mas. The median coadded catalog depth for a 1 95 diameter aperture at signal-to-noise ratio = 10 is g = 24.7, r = 24.4, i = 23.8, z = 23.1, and Y = 21.7 mag. {DES} {DR}2 includes ∼691 million distinct astronomical objects detected in 10,169 coadded image tiles of size 0.534 deg2 produced from 76,217 single-epoch images. After a basic quality selection, benchmark galaxy and stellar samples contain 543 million and 145 million objects, respectively. These data are accessible through several interfaces, including interactive image visualization tools, web-based query clients, image cutout servers, and Jupyter notebooks. {DES} {DR}2 constitutes the largest photometric data set to date at the achieved depth and photometric precision.},

It provides a 25x38 arcsec. field with 0.5 arcsec. sampling along each of twenty five 38X1 arcsec slitlets. The output format is optimized to match the 4096x4096 pixel {CCD} detectors in each of two cameras individually optimized for the blue and the red ends of the spectrum, respectively. A process of "interleaved nod-and-shuffle" will be applied to permit quantum noise-limited sky subtraction. Using {VPH} gratings, spectral resolutions of 3000 and 7000 are provided. The full spectral range is covered in a single exposure at R=3000, and in two exposures in the R=7000 mode. The use of transmissive coated optics, {VPH} gratings and optimized mirror coatings ensures a throughput (including telescope atmosphere and detector) {\textgreater} 30\% over a wide spectral range. The concentric image-slicer design ensures an excellent and uniform image quality across the full field. To maximize scientific return, the whole instrument is configured for remote observing, pipeline data reduction, and the accumulation of calibration image libraries.},

	abstract = {Synthetic source injection ({SSI}), the insertion of sources into pixel-level on-sky images, is a powerful method for characterizing object detection and measurement in wide-field, astronomical imaging surveys. Within the Dark Energy Survey ({DES}), {SSI} plays a critical role in characterizing all necessary algorithms used in converting images to catalogs, and in deriving quantities needed for the cosmology analysis, such as object detection rates, galaxy redshift estimation, galaxy magnification, star-galaxy classification, and photometric performance. We present here a source injection catalog of \$146\$ million injections spanning the entire 5000 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ {DES} footprint, generated using the Balrog {SSI} pipeline. Through this sample, we demonstrate that the {DES} Year 6 (Y6) image processing pipeline provides accurate estimates of the object properties, for both galaxies and stars, at the percent-level, and we highlight specific regimes where the accuracy is reduced. We then show the consistency between {SSI} and data catalogs, for all galaxy samples developed within the weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses of {DES} Y6. The consistency between the two catalogs also extends to their correlations with survey observing properties (seeing, airmass, depth, extinction, etc.). Finally, we highlight a number of applications of this catalog to the {DES} Y6 cosmology analysis. This dataset is the largest {SSI} catalog produced at this fidelity and will serve as a key testing ground for exploring the utility of {SSI} catalogs in upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.},

The camera was designed and constructed by the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration and meets or exceeds the stringent requirements designed for the wide-field and supernova surveys for which the collaboration uses it. The camera consists of a five-element optical corrector, seven filters, a shutter with a 60 cm aperture, and a charge-coupled device ({CCD}) focal plane of 250 μm thick fully depleted {CCDs} cooled inside a vacuum Dewar. The 570 megapixel focal plane comprises 62 2k × 4k {CCDs} for imaging and 12 2k × 2k {CCDs} for guiding and focus. The {CCDs} have 15 μm × 15 μm pixels with a plate scale of 0.″263 pixel-1. A hexapod system provides state-of-the-art focus and alignment capability. The camera is read out in 20 s with 6-9 electron readout noise.
