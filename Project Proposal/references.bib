	abstract = {This paper describes the Wide Field Spectrograph ({WiFeS}) under construction at the Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics ({RSAA}) of the Australian National University ({ANU}) for the {ANU} 2.3m telescope at the Siding Spring Observatory. {WiFeS} is a powerful integral field, double-beam, concentric, image-slicing spectrograph designed to deliver excellent thoughput, wavelength stability, spectrophotometric performance and superb image quality along with wide spectral coverage throughout the 320-950 nm wavelength region. It provides a 25x38 arcsec. field with 0.5 arcsec. sampling along each of twenty five 38X1 arcsec slitlets. The output format is optimized to match the 4096x4096 pixel {CCD} detectors in each of two cameras individually optimized for the blue and the red ends of the spectrum, respectively. A process of "interleaved nod-and-shuffle" will be applied to permit quantum noise-limited sky subtraction. Using {VPH} gratings, spectral resolutions of 3000 and 7000 are provided. The full spectral range is covered in a single exposure at R=3000, and in two exposures in the R=7000 mode. The use of transmissive coated optics, {VPH} gratings and optimized mirror coatings ensures a throughput (including telescope atmosphere and detector) {\textgreater} 30\% over a wide spectral range. The concentric image-slicer design ensures an excellent and uniform image quality across the full field. To maximize scientific return, the whole instrument is configured for remote observing, pipeline data reduction, and the accumulation of calibration image libraries.},

	abstract = {The operation of the {ANU} 2.3 m telescope transitioned from classically scheduled remote observing to fully autonomous queue scheduled observing in March 2023. The instrument currently supported is {WiFeS}, a visible-light low-resolution image-slicing integral field spectrograph with a \$25{\textasciicircum}'' ×38{\textasciicircum}''\$ field of view (offering precision spectrophotometry free from aperture effects). It is highly suitable for rapid spectroscopic follow-up of astronomical transient events and regular cadence observations. The new control system implements flexible queue scheduling and supports rapid response override for target-of-opportunity observations. The {ANU} 2.3 m is the largest optical telescope to have been retro-fitted for autonomous operation to date, and it remains a national facility servicing a broad range of science cases. We present an overview of the automated control system and report on the first six months of continuous operation.},

	abstract = {Synthetic source injection ({SSI}), the insertion of sources into pixel-level on-sky images, is a powerful method for characterizing object detection and measurement in wide-field, astronomical imaging surveys. Within the Dark Energy Survey ({DES}), {SSI} plays a critical role in characterizing all necessary algorithms used in converting images to catalogs, and in deriving quantities needed for the cosmology analysis, such as object detection rates, galaxy redshift estimation, galaxy magnification, star-galaxy classification, and photometric performance. We present here a source injection catalog of \$146\$ million injections spanning the entire 5000 deg\${\textasciicircum}2\$ {DES} footprint, generated using the Balrog {SSI} pipeline. Through this sample, we demonstrate that the {DES} Year 6 (Y6) image processing pipeline provides accurate estimates of the object properties, for both galaxies and stars, at the percent-level, and we highlight specific regimes where the accuracy is reduced. We then show the consistency between {SSI} and data catalogs, for all galaxy samples developed within the weak lensing and galaxy clustering analyses of {DES} Y6. The consistency between the two catalogs also extends to their correlations with survey observing properties (seeing, airmass, depth, extinction, etc.). Finally, we highlight a number of applications of this catalog to the {DES} Y6 cosmology analysis. This dataset is the largest {SSI} catalog produced at this fidelity and will serve as a key testing ground for exploring the utility of {SSI} catalogs in upcoming surveys such as the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.},

	abstract = {The Dark Energy Camera is a new imager with a 2.°2 diameter field of view mounted at the prime focus of the Victor M. Blanco 4 m telescope on Cerro Tololo near La Serena, Chile. The camera was designed and constructed by the Dark Energy Survey Collaboration and meets or exceeds the stringent requirements designed for the wide-field and supernova surveys for which the collaboration uses it. The camera consists of a five-element optical corrector, seven filters, a shutter with a 60 cm aperture, and a charge-coupled device ({CCD}) focal plane of 250 μm thick fully depleted {CCDs} cooled inside a vacuum Dewar. The 570 megapixel focal plane comprises 62 2k × 4k {CCDs} for imaging and 12 2k × 2k {CCDs} for guiding and focus. The {CCDs} have 15 μm × 15 μm pixels with a plate scale of 0.″263 pixel-1. A hexapod system provides state-of-the-art focus and alignment capability. The camera is read out in 20 s with 6-9 electron readout noise. This paper provides a technical description of the camera's engineering, construction, installation, and current status.},
